## Manual

This project is a web application designed to keep track of scan requests from badges linked to students during an event.  
The scans can have different values depending on the event to keep track of drinks, presences or else.

The project is divided into 6 applications :

- The account application  

- The api application  

- The badges application

- The core application.

- The events application.  

- The general application.  

## launch and run

When launched, the embedded program will send a post request to the website to receive the different scanning type of the current event. Then, the embedded program will wait for scans and send an other post request with the current scanning type (or mode) and the badge uid. The webapp will send a response depending on the scan validity and store the scan into the database.

## account app

Handle the website Users data.

### views

- init_page:

- scan_post_management:

Receive an UID and a mode from the embedded program in a json format after receiving a POST request. The function checks for a StudentBadge with this UID and assign his login to a new Scan object along with his other relative informations.  
If the uid sent by the scan has not StudentBadge assigned yet, the scan login is set as UNDEFINED.  
  
It also checks for the validity of the scan depending the mode amount and the number of time an UID has been scanned for the mode in the current event.

### models
